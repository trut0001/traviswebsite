    "text": "Article A - The Green Divide: How Wealth Buys Shade in a Warming World\nThe article studied here is titled “The Green Divide: How Wealth Buys Shade in a Warming World” by Kate Newton, and it is available online from Stuff.co.nz. Stuff is a New Zealand news media website, whose parent company is a media conglomerate named Stuff Ltd. This is considered “print media” because Stuff sources their articles from Stuff Ltd newspapers, such as The Post and The Press. \nThe article summarises how tree shade is an important counter to global warming. The article provides visualisations showing how high-income neighbourhoods have more access to tree shade while low-income neighbourhoods have less access to tree shade.\nThe first six paragraphs are background information as to why tree shade is better at lowering temperatures than other shade. It does this through three methods. First, the author invites the reader to imagine a hot day and asks if they would prefer sitting under the shade of a building or a tree. Second, the author provides a quote from a professor on urban forestry, where he states his preference for the shade of a tree. Third, the author provides a graphic showing how trees provide better cooling than buildings because of their shade and evaporation of rainwater. This context is useful because it explains why tree shade is important and why it is a problem that tree shade is less available for poor communities.\nThe lede is located in the first sentence of the article and just below the graphic title, which is normal for printed media. It is bolded to catch the reader’s attention. This lede provides further meaning to the title, stating:\n“The cooling shade of trees will be crucial to adapting to climate change. But data from New Zealand cities shows tree cover is uneven — and often dictated by wealth.”\nThe summary is found after the background information. It states:\n“At a more fundamental level, wealth often corresponds to whether you live in a cool neighbourhood or a hot one. Shade and prosperity are linked together in the phrase ‘leafy suburbs,’ used as a byword for New Zealand’s well-heeled, established neighbourhoods.”\nThe article then provides more details, maps, and other visualisations to support the statement that shade is more available in rich communities. It is assumed that the reader either be from New Zealand, live in New Zealand, or have knowledge of the different cities and neighbourhoods of New Zealand. \nThe main result of the story is a call to action for local governments to be mindful of tree shade as they develop communities. The purpose of the article is to equip the public and decision-makers with information so that they can affect change for all communities, not just those that are affluent. The main result is located in is the last paragraph of the article:\n“What tree canopy mapping can do, though, is show where trees are and aren’t — and how that is changing. “If [councils] know that there are neighbourhoods that only have four per cent canopy cover, they would hopefully see it as their responsibility to increase canopy cover in that area.”\nArticle B - Wordle, 15 Million Tweets Later\nThe article studied here is “Wordle, 15 Million Tweets Later”, available online at observablehq.com. Observable is a company that provides data visualisation solutions for web apps. A portion of their website is a blog to showcase data visualisation work. This article was published by a public contributor named Robert Lesser.\nThe blog post analyses the behaviour of people who play Wordle and share their results on Twitter. Key findings were that there is some level of player success predictability based on the structure of the Wordle (ex: having double letters), and that players are less likely to share their results on Twitter if the word is more difficult. This is likely due to players performing poorly and not wanting to share their results. \nThe first two paragraphs provide background information on Wordle’s popularity. The article states that a reason Wordle became so popular is because players started sharing their Wordle results on Twitter. This background information is relevant because it provides context before the author shares his analysis.\nThe lede in this article is found in the title itself - “Wordle, 15 Million Tweets Later”. Although it is unusual to put the lede in the title, this is useful in an informal blog post because it grabs the reader’s attention. This title provides both context and scale to the reader. “15 Million” is a large number and shows the scale of this analysis, and the reader immediately understands that the context of the article is about Wordle. Because this analysis is exploratory, there is not a call to action or recommendation in the article or the lede. Instead, this lede describes the purpose behind the article - exploring a large number of tweets about Wordle. \nThe summary of the article can be found just after introduction, and it is a simple sentence:\n“So, to really understand Wordle, I had to look at the tweets – all 15 million of them”.\nThis summary is similar to the lede in that it concisely states the purpose of this blog post - to share his analysis of 15 million tweets. The author is simply sharing some analyses that he found interesting.  \nThe main result are the various visualisations and findings that the reader can explore. The author provides a final section named “Further Exploration”, which includes a link to an appendix with more visualisations. Another notable feature of this blog post is that the reader can click on each visualisation to view the raw code used to make the visualisations. The entire blog post is intended to be inspected, explored, and used by the reader for further analysis, if desired. \n\n\nArticle C - How did Australia’s housing market get so bad, and is it all negative gearing’s fault?\nThe article studied here is titled “How did Australia’s housing market get so bad, and is it all negative gearing’s fault?”by Guardian Australia, and it is available on The Guardian’s Youtube Channel. Guardian Australia is the Australian website of the British online and print newspaper, The Guardian. This article is a five minute video that utilises journalistic storytelling and data visualisations. This video format is used to concisely and casually communicate to a large audience. \nThe video summarises two key contributors to the high prices of the Australia housing market - negative gearing and the capital gains tax. The video explores what these two terms are, their history in Australia policymaking, and how they contribute to making the Australian housing market so expensive. \nThe video opens with background information about the Australian housing market. The host shows a time series plot that compares house prices versus household disposable income from 1989 to 2022. Since 2000, the gap between disposable income and house prices has widened considerably.This means that as each year has passed, houses are less affordable for the average consumer. This context is helpful to the viewer so they know what problem is being discussed and why. \nThe lede of the video is in the title - “How did Australia’s housing market get so bad, and is it all negative gearing’s fault?” Putting the lede in the title is standard practice for YouTube videos - even from reputable news sources - as the thumbnail and video title are used to drive interest and summarise the video topic to the prospective viewer.  \nThe video summarises their main point from 4:05 to 4:30. The main point is that both negative gearing and low capital gains tax rates have contributed to increased housing prices because they incentivise investors to continue investing in the housing market. The video states:\n“Investors are now so heavily protected by the tax system that they are willing to take even bigger risks and spend even more money on the properties they are buying, which of course makes housing prices rise faster, which then makes the combination of negative gearing and capitals gains discounts even more profitable, which means investors are willing to spend even more, which makes house prices rise even faster, and would you look at that - it’s like we’re are almost in a vicious cycle.” \nOther factors may contribute to higher prices in the housing market, but those are not discussed in the video. This is understandable for two reasons. First, this video is both concise and casual, so it is limiting the scope to two key topics. Second, it is focusing on answering the question “is it all negative gearing’s fault?” This is done by explaining what negative gearing is and then exploring the capital gains tax. The video does not assume that the viewer has previous knowledge about negative gearing or the capital gains tax.\nThe main result of this video is the audience’s better understanding of how Australia’s housing market got so expensive, and how negative gearing and capital gains tax incentives have significantly contributed to rising house prices. There is no explicit call to action for community building, advocacy, or policy change. Instead, Guardian Australia is providing information to their audience about a particular social issue and letting the audience decide what to do with that information. \nComparing And Contrasting the Articles\nThere are three similarities among the articles:\n\nUse of data visualisations. All of the articles use data visualisations to communicate their point. Well-designed data visualisations are helpful for audiences to understand, trust, and retain information. The Stuff article primarily uses heat maps while the Wordle blog post and Guardian video use time series plots. \nUse of an attention-grabbing hook statement. All of the articles try to catch the reader’s attention with either their title or lede. This is to be expected, as these articles are online and require the reader to click through and engage. The authors want the audience to make the decision to engage with the material based on a hook that is appealing to them. \nUse of colloquial language. All of the articles used a communication style that is non-academic and appeals to a large public audience. For example, the Stuff article has hand-drawn illustrations, the blog post is formatted as an approachable blog, and the video has an in-person host using gen-z vernacular like “cooked”. \n\nThere are also formatting differences among the articles. Both the Stuff article and Wordle blog post use the inverted pyramid format, while the Guardian Australia video uses an hourglass format. The inverted pyramid format is effective in catching the reader’s attention with a main point, supporting that main point with more details, then ending with supplemental data. The Stuff article starts with the lede in the opening sentence, while Stuff provides the lede in the title. They then follow up with more details and supplemental data. The hourglass format provides the crucial details in the beginning, gives the narrative, and then ends by summarising the main point. The hourglass format is effective in ensuring that the audience comprehends and retains the full picture of what is being communicated. The Guardian video starts with the crucial information about the housing crisis, provides the narrative around negative gearing and capital gains tax, and then ends with the summarising point of how housing prices continue to rise. \nAnother difference is in the intent of the articles. The intent of the Stuff article is to educate the audience and provide a call to action in regards to global warming. Stuff suggests that local governments should be more mindful of tree shade when planning communities. On the other hand, the Wordle blog post and the Guardian video intend to be educational and do not have an explicit call to action to their audience."
